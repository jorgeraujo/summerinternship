Challenge
---------

RedLight focus have been focusing on Healthcare since some time ago.
One of your goals is to revolutionize how Healthcare services are provided to patients all around the world.

With this in mind, we will ask you to build a tiny Web Application to help doctors in an Emergency Room.

### Build a static web page

Here's a (extremely) simplified version of what a Web Application for an emergency room would look like.

![Emergency Room](readme/emergency_room.png)

Your first task is to build a static web page (using HTML and CSS) mirroring the picture above. You don't need to mirror the picture exactly as it is, but the structure must be the same.

You can use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, Foundation and similar.


### Build a dynamic web application

- Your second task is to build a dynamic web application that will serve the contents of the emergency room dinamically from a DataBase.

- Additionally, implement the ability to add more patients using the text field you see on the page.

You are free to choose any kind of technologies you're familiar with to achieve this task, be it **Ruby on Rails**, **Sinatra**, **ExpressJS**, **Django**, or any other.
Also, use whatever DataBase you're used to, be it Relational such as **PostgreSQL** and **MySQL**, document based such as **MongoDB** or any other.

> If you're unfamiliar with server-side web frameworks, use Javascript to implement the same functionality.

Upload your work
----------------

When you're done, be sure to upload your work back to Github by committing directly to master.
